<p>My name is Jessica Kincaid and I am a visual artist on my way to becaoming a web developer. I have made use of my artistic strengths and detail-oriented tendencies to become an empatheitc educator.</p>
<section>
<p>Often, I make tapestries with glass beads and thread. They usually depict surreal scenery or imagery from nature. I received a master's in fine art from Cranbrook Academy of Art and have sustained a continuous career as a professional artist since then.</p>
<p>Soon after obtaining my MFA, I became a special education paraprofessional in a public school. I worked in public schools for nine years and found it intrinsically rewarding, but I chose to seek a position that would provide a living income.</p>
<p>I went to the MakerSpace at my nearby library and used the computers to learn to write code, and do some 3D printing. I took classes in Web Development and earned a certificate from my local community college. After graduation, I began mentoring for Kansas City Women in Technology's Coding and Cocktails program.</p>
</p>I have assisted in the instruction of topics: Version Control, Front-End Architecture, and JavaScript. Since beginning LaunchCode, learning Python has strengthened my skills as a programmer and I am preparing for the next stage in my career: a position where I can use my skills in a technology setting.</p>
