<p>So far, I am really enjoying this course. Everyone is very goal-oriented and positive. I have to confess I was afraid I was going to have to drop out until I was able to figure out my Crypto code with the help of people from the community.</p>

<p>I was so anxious I had a dream that I was talking to a dog and it told me to sing a song. I thought, "This sure is a sign that I'm not cut out for writing code." But it is sinking in and I hope to become more fluent in this language of programming.</p>
<p>I've always known I wanted to be an artist and that was what I'm made for. Taking this class will hopefully help me find a way to earn a living wage, but also explore the other forms of imagination it takes to develop a complex piece of code. The encryption code required a form of creative thinking that's a lot like generating a new idea for a work of art.</p>
<p>I had to miss my reading group on Thursday and it would have been so appropriate as they were discussing "The Library of Babel" byt Jorge Luis Borges. That is a creative work of similar complexity.</p>
