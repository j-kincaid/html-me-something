<p>My name is Jessica Kincaid and I am a visual artist on my way to becaoming a web developer. I have made use of my artistic strengths and detail-oriented tendencies to become an empatheitc educator.</p>
<section>
<p>Often, I make tapestries with glass beads and thread. They usually depict surreal scenery or imagery from nature. I received a master's in fine art from Cranbrook Academy of Art and have sustained a continuous career as a professional artist since then.</p>
<p>Soon after obtaining my MFA, I became a special education paraprofessional in a public school. I worked in public schools for nine years and found it intrinsically rewarding, but I chose to seek a position that would provide a living income.</p>
